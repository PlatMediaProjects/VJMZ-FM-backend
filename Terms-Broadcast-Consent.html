      <h2>Authority & Rights</h2>
      <p>You are the copyright owner and/or have full legal permission from the owner(s) (artist, label, management) to submit the recording(s), artwork, and metadata for airplay consideration and promotional use. You warrant that no submission violates or infringes any third-party rights.</p>

This license may be revoked by written notice, but will not affect prior lawful uses.</p>

      <h2>Clean Radio Edit</h2>

      <h2>No Guarantee of Airplay</h2>
      <p>Submission does not guarantee review timing, feedback, or airplay. Programming decisions are at the Station’s sole discretion.</p>

      <h2>Indemnity</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Station, its affiliates, and personnel from any claims, losses, or liabilities arising from or related to your submission, including copyright/clearance disputes.</p>
